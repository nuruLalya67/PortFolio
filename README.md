## RESEARCH DESCRIPTION:


1.2	Problem Statement


| SOLVING MULTIDIMENSIONAL KNAPSACK PROBLEM (MKP) BY USING SIMULATED ANNEALING WITH DIFFERENT RESTART TEMPERATURE. |


Metaheuristic is found to be a reasonable method to solve MKP, such as SA. SA is one good metaheuristic method for solving MKP which can handle a large and unpredictable data. Nevertheless, SA is found to always possible to become stuck at local minima. Previous studies shows that a cooling schedule of SA plays important rules to reduce SA from being stuck at local minima. One of the approaches is to restart the temperature adaptively. However, previous studies are lacking in discussing on how to increase temperature. Hence, this study proposed SA with various restart temperature for solving MKP.
